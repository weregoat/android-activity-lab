# android-test-lab
Note for whomever may stuble upon this: it is just a repository to store experiments and prototypes for my own androidpet project. 

_dev_ and _master_ branches have working prototypes (stress on prototype) that I plan to base the *dead man handle* app on (I am still learning).

Other branches are there only to save for my future self some particular way to do things. 

I strongly suggest you don't use this directly, but I would be really interested if you decide to solve some of the problems in a different way.
