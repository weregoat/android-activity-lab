# android-test-lab
Just a repository to store android experiments and prototypes 

_dev_ and _master_ branches should have working prototypes (stress on prototype) for the *dead man handle* app.
_job-schedul__ branch has a prototype with job scheduling instead of services, but it keep crashing for reasons I haven't figured out yet.
Other branches are there only to remember me what I did.
