# android-test-lab
Note for whomever may stuble upon this: it is just a repository to store experiments and prototypes for android. 

_dev_ and _master_ branches have working prototypes (stress on prototype) that I plan to base the *dead man handle* app on (I am still learning).

_job-scheduler_ branch has a prototype with job scheduling instead of services, but it keeps crashing at night for reasons I haven't figured out yet.

Other branches are there only to save for my future self some particular way to do things.
