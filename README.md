# android-test-lab
Just a repository to store android experiments and prototypes 

_dev_ and _master_ branches should have working prototypes (stress on prototype) for the *dead man handle* app.

_job-scheduler_ branch has a prototype with job scheduling instead of services, but it keep crashing for reasons I haven't figured out yet.
Other branches are there only to remember myself what I did.
