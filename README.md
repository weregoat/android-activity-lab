# android-test-lab
Just a repository to store android experiments and prototypes 

dev and master branch should have a running prototype (stress on prototype).
job-schedule branch has a prototype with job scheduling instead of services, but it keep crashing for reasons I haven't figured out yet.
Other branches are there only to remember me what I did.
