# android-test-lab
Note for whomever may stuble upon this: it is just a repository to store experiments and prototypes for my own androidpet project. 

_dev_ and _master_ branches have working prototypes (stress on prototype) that I plan to base the *dead man handle* app on (I am still learning).

Other branches are there only to save for my future self some particular way to do things. 

I strongly suggest you don't use this directly, but I would be really interested if you decide to solve some of the problems in a different way.

My old phone's speaker has given up the ghost. The phone runs still, but without the possibility to generate alerts it doesn't make much sense to use it for this (I am thinking about re-rigging it with PostMarketOS and using it as a portable PC or something). 
New phone is running Oreo and has a different set of sensors, so next versions will reflect that.
